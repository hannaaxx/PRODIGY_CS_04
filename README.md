# Basic Keylogger Tool

## Overview
This project is a **basic keylogger tool** built using Python. It records and logs keystrokes to a text file for monitoring purposes. The keylogger captures:
- Character keys (e.g., `a`, `b`, `1`, etc.)
- Special keys (e.g., `Enter`, `Shift`, `Ctrl`)

⚠️ **Note:** This tool is intended for **educational purposes only**. Ensure you have proper authorization before using it.

---

## Features
- Logs all keystrokes to a file (`key_log.txt`).
- Captures both character and special keys.
- Stops logging when the `Escape` key is pressed.

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- `pynput` library

---

## Installation

Unauthorized use of a keylogger can lead to legal consequences and may violate privacy laws.
